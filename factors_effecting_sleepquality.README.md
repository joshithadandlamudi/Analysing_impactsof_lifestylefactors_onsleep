Project Overview :
Ever wondered how your **daily habits affect your sleep?** This project dives deep into the connection between **lifestyle factors** and **sleep quality** using real-world data from Kaggle. By analyzing patterns in **physical activity, stress, heart rate, and BMI**, we uncover key insights into what really helps (or harms) your sleep.  

Using **data science and machine learning**, I predict sleep disorders and highlight ways to improve overall sleep health.  

🔑 Key Takeaways :
✅ **Staying active = Better sleep!** More physical activity is linked to higher sleep quality.  
❌ **High stress = Poor sleep.** Increased stress levels negatively impact both **sleep duration** and **quality**.  
🤖 **AI can predict sleep issues!** Random Forest and SVM (RBF Kernel) models showed the best accuracy in classifying sleep disorders.  

 🛠️ Tech & Tools  
- **Python**  | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Naïve Bayes  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Random Forest  

 🔍 How We Did It  
1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature engineering.  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing relationships between sleep quality and lifestyle factors.  
3️⃣ **Feature Selection** – Identifying the most important factors influencing sleep.  
4️⃣ **Machine Learning** – Training multiple models to classify sleep disorders.  
5️⃣ **Model Evaluation** – Using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and precision-recall analysis.  

 📁 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)  
- **Features Analyzed**: BMI, Gender, Sleep Quality, Heart Rate, Physical Activity, Stress Level, Sleep Disorders.
